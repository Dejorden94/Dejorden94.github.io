                    My first internship during my second year at the HvA was at embot.ai. This was a small company that made chatbots. 
                    <br>
                    My main responsibility there was to redesign their website, I worked with a other intern on the redesign, she would make a first design and I would make more iterations of that design and eventually translate that design into a web page.

            For these projects I had the chance to learn php, I mostly learned this by following a Lynda course and some lessons from my mentor at embot.
            What I manly learned here was how to work at a professional environment and how solve problems on my own.
            Unfortunately embot does no longer exist and the website has been taken down, but on this page you can find my documents I made during this period.

            Below you can view a proposal document I made for the emobot website.
