                    In the second year at CMD we got to choose between different directions to take our education, my choice was the tech side of things. During these theme semester we followed a course that was all about front-end, back-end and databases. 
                    The assignment was to make a dating app functionality, my dating app was called hooked. In this dating app you could match with people who had the same interests as you.
