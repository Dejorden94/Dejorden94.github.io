                    With this assignment we had to develop a game based on a scene from the Netflix series the letter for the king. We chose to base the game on a scene from the first episode where the main character gets knocked of his hors while it  takes off with top speed.                </section>

            In the game you play as a knight that nobody can stand, even you the horse. The objective of the game is to humiliate him as much as possible. You do this by running into beehives, wash lines, mud and metal lanterns. The time limit is three minutes and you can get two different endings. One where the knight is not demoted and when where he loses his knight hood.
            <br>
            For this project I did everything for the development side of the game.
